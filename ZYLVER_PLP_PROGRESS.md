## Overall Goal for PLP:
Transform the ZYLVER.IN storefront product listing pages into a world-class jewelry e-commerce experience.

## I. Initial Bug Fixing & Product Display (Completed)

This initial phase focused on resolving critical bugs that prevented products from appearing on the Product Listing Page (`/zylver-test-category`).

### A. Completed Tasks & Fixes:

1.  **Resolved 500 Internal Server Error on PLP:**
    *   **Issue:** The PLP (`/zylver-test-category`) was throwing a 500 Internal Server Error.
    *   **Fix:** Corrected an invalid component call in `packages/Webkul/Shop/src/Resources/views/categories/view.blade.php`. Changed `<x-shop::components.pagination />` to `<x-shop::pagination />`.
    *   **Verification:** Caches cleared, server restarted. PLP page now loads.
    *   **(Commit: `36161851cd` on `feat/zylver-plp-redesign-v1`, part of PR #5)**

2.  **Diagnosed and Fixed "No Treasures Found" on PLP:**
    *   **Issue:** PLP loaded but showed "No Treasures Found" because the test product (SKU: `ZYL-TEST-001`) was not appearing.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:**
        *   The API endpoint (`/api/products?category_id=6`) returned an empty `data` array.
        *   Initial product creation attempts via Tinker scripts showed that product attributes (name, price, description) were not being saved correctly to the `product_attribute_values` table.
        *   This prevented the `product_flat` table (which denormalizes product data for quick frontend access) from being populated for the product.
    *   **Investigation Steps:**
        *   Verified "Zylver Test Category" ID is `6`.
        *   Analyzed `ProductRepository::create()` and `AbstractType::create()`: Found they only create the basic product record.
        *   Analyzed `AbstractType::update()`: Found it saves attribute values and other relations.
        *   Determined that `ProductFlat` updates are triggered by events (`catalog.product.create.after`, `catalog.product.update.after`) handled by `Webkul\Product\Listeners\Product`, which calls `Webkul\Product\Helpers\Indexers\Flat::refresh($product)`.
    *   **Fix & Verification:**
        *   Created a robust Tinker script (`/tmp/create_product_v3.php`) that:
            1.  Deletes any existing product with SKU `ZYL-TEST-001`.
            2.  Calls `ProductRepository->create()` with basic data.
            3.  Calls `ProductRepository->update()` with full attribute data and relations.
            4.  **Crucially, directly calls `app(Webkul\Product\Helpers\Indexers\Flat::class)->refresh($product)`** to ensure `ProductFlat` is populated, bypassing potential event dispatching issues in the Tinker environment for reliable testing.
        *   Executed the script, successfully creating Product ID 4 (SKU: `ZYL-TEST-001`).
        *   Verified that attributes were saved in `product_attribute_values`.
        *   Verified that the `product_flat` table was populated for Product ID 4.
        *   Verified the API endpoint `/api/products?category_id=6` now returns the product.
        *   Verified the PLP page `http://localhost:55838/zylver-test-category` now displays the "Zylver Test Product (v3)".

### B. Current Status:

*   **The "Zylver Test Product" (SKU: `ZYL-TEST-001`) is now successfully appearing on the PLP (`/zylver-test-category`).**
*   The primary blocker for starting the PLP redesign has been resolved.
*   The `feat/zylver-plp-redesign-v1` branch (associated with PR #5) is up-to-date with these fixes.

## II. PLP Redesign - Next Steps (Pending)

Now that the product data is correctly displayed, the PLP redesign work can commence. The following phases are planned (details to be fleshed out based on ZYLVER's specific design requirements):

### Phase 2.A: Basic Layout & Structure
*   Implement the overall new layout for the PLP as per mockups/design specifications.
*   Update the main product grid/list structure.
*   Ensure responsiveness across devices.

### Phase 2.B: Product Card Redesign
*   Redesign individual product cards to match the new ZYLVER aesthetic.
*   Update display of product image, name, price, quick view, wishlist, etc.

### Phase 2.C: Filtering & Sorting Enhancements
*   Review and implement new filtering options (e.g., by material, gemstone, price range, style).
*   Enhance sorting capabilities.
*   Improve the UI/UX of filter application and display.

### Phase 2.D: Advanced Features & UX Improvements
*   Implement features like "Load More" or infinite scrolling.
*   Enhance hover effects or quick view functionality.
*   Integrate any new promotional elements or badges on product cards.
*   Address any specific UX improvements requested by ZYLVER.

### Phase 2.E: Styling & Theming
*   Apply ZYLVER's branding, color palette, and typography consistently.
*   Ensure all elements are visually polished and cohesive.

### Phase 2.F: Testing & Refinement
*   Thoroughly test PLP functionality across different browsers and devices.
*   Gather feedback and make necessary refinements.
